Hey! I wanted to share some **important information** about the mod we discussed yesterday.

## Quick Summary

Here are the *key points* to remember:

- The mod supports **multiple game versions**
- Installation is straightforward
- Compatible with other popular mods

### Installation Steps

1. Download the latest version
2. Extract to your `BepInEx/plugins` folder
3. Launch the game and enjoy!

> **Note:** Make sure you have the latest SPT version installed before using this mod.

Here's a useful code snippet for the config:

`enableFeature: true`

If you need the full configuration example:

```
{
  "enableFeature": true,
  "maxItems": 50,
  "debugMode": false
}
```

I've been testing it for the past week and it's been ~~buggy~~ **working perfectly**! The performance improvements are significant.
