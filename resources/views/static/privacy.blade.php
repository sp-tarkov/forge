                        This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any
                        processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we will

                <p><br></p>
                <p>Whenever you visit one of our websites, a direct connection between your browser and the SoundCloud server will be
                    established immediately after the plug-in has been activated. As a result, SoundCloud will be notified that you have

                    emphasize that we as the provider of the websites do not have any knowledge of the data transferred and the use of
                    this data by SoundCloud.</p>
