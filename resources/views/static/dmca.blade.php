    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 26, 2025<br><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 26, 2025</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Forge respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.</p>

    <p>This Copyright Notice explains how copyright owners can request removal of content that infringes their intellectual property rights, and how users can respond to such requests.</p>

    <h2 id="our-role">2. Our Role as a Platform</h2>
    <p>The Forge serves as a platform that hosts user-generated content, including modifications, tools, and related materials for Single Player Tarkov. We do not review all content for copyright compliance before it is posted.</p>

    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The Forge does not make legal determinations about whether content infringes copyright. We act as an intermediary, processing valid DMCA notices and counter-notices according to the procedures outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2 id="response-procedure">3. Response Procedure</h2>
    <p>When we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acknowledge receipt</strong> within 2 business days</li>
        <li><strong>Review the notice</strong> for completeness and validity</li>
        <li><strong>Remove or disable access</strong> to the allegedly infringing content promptly if the notice is valid</li>
        <li><strong>Notify the user</strong> who posted the content about the takedown and provide information about counter-notice procedures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="infringement-actions">4. Infringement Actions</h2>
    <p><strong>Content Removal:</strong></p>
    <p>Upon receiving a valid DMCA notice, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the material that is claimed to be infringing. This action is taken without prejudice to the rights of either party.</p>

    <p><strong>User Notification:</strong></p>
    <p>We will make reasonable efforts to notify the user who posted the content about the removal and provide them with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A copy of the DMCA notice (with personal information redacted as appropriate)</li>
        <li>Information about their right to file a counter-notice</li>
        <li>Instructions on the counter-notice process</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="filing-claim">5. Filing a Copyright Claim</h2>

    <p>To file a valid DMCA takedown notice, you must be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work, or</li>
        <li>An agent authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Good Faith Requirement:</strong> You must have a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</p>

    <h3 id="required-information">5.2 Required Information</h3>
    <p>Your DMCA notice must include all of the following information:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Physical or electronic signature</strong> of the copyright owner or authorized agent</li>
        <li><strong>Identification of the copyrighted work</strong> claimed to have been infringed (provide title, author, registration number if applicable)</li>
        <li><strong>Identification of the infringing material</strong> and its location on The Forge (provide specific URLs or mod names)</li>

    <h2 id="counter-claims">6. Counter-Claims</h2>
    <p>If you believe your content was removed in error or misidentification, you may file a counter-notice. To be valid, your counter-notice must include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Your physical or electronic signature</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Identification of the material</strong> that was removed and its previous location</li>

        <li><strong>A statement agreeing</strong> to accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notice</li>
    </ol>
